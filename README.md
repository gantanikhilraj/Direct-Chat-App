# Direct-Chat-&-QR App for WhatsApp


" Direct Chat & QR: Initiate conversations without saving contacts "


## Project Details

- Users can access the App and enter the phone number of the person they want to communicate with.
- The App will then redirect the user to a WhatsApp chat window with the corresponding phone number.
- This can be particularly useful when communicating with someone for a short period.
- It can also help users to maintain privacy by not adding unnecessary contacts to their phone's address book.
- This App may be especially useful for businesses or professionals who frequently communicate with new clients or customers but do not want to add every contact to their phone's address book.
- Users can communicate or chat with individuals who have a mobile number from any country, as long as they have a valid WhatsApp account associated with that number.
- Additionally, users should ensure they have the correct phone number before sending a message, as there is no saved contact to verify the information.
- Generate QR codes for any phone number directly within the app.Once created, these QR codes can be saved for future use or shared across various platforms.
- By scanning a QR code, users can instantly initiate a chat on WhatsApp, bypassing the need to manually enter or save phone numbers. Itâ€™s quick, efficient, and seamless.
